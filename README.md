# IOTA Transaction Stream

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/pRizz/IOTA-Transaction-Stream.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

A microservice that transmits new transactions from an IOTA node to any number of listeners, in real-time, through WebSockets.

This is a prerequisite for running Chatangle or Votangle.

# Installation Instructions

## Dependencies
You may need a C compiler installed on your system before you can install IOTA Transaction Stream. This is because the ZeroMQ dependency must compile during installation.

On CentOS:

```bash
sudo yum -y install gcc-c++ make
```

## General Installation
For global installation:

```bash
npm install -g iota-transaction-stream
```

This will make IOTA Transaction Stream available as the command `iota-transaction-stream`.

### Installation Errors
If you get errors during install about bad permissions, your `npm` was probably installed as the root user. It is recommended to install `npm` as non-root, like with `nvm`. A workaround is to install with the `--unsafe-perm` flag like so:

```bash
npm install -g --unsafe-perm iota-transaction-stream
```

# Usage
You must have an [IRI](https://github.com/iotaledger/iri) with config `ZMQ_ENABLED = true`. The ZMQ runs on port `5556` by default.

If globally installed, example:

```bash
iota-transaction-stream --iotaIP 123.45.67.890 --iotaZMQPort 5556 --webSocketServerPort 8008
```

If installed locally or running from an IDE:

```bash
npm run start -- --iotaIP 123.45.67.890 --iotaZMQPort 5556 webSocketServerPort 8008
```

Running in the background, example: 

```bash
nohup iota-transaction-stream --iotaIP 123.45.67.890 --iotaZMQPort 5556 --webSocketServerPort 8008 >> output.log &
```

Then tail the logs with 

```bash
tail -f output.log
```

### Hooking Into The Stream

These lines of Javascript can be copy-pasted into the Chrome console after starting the server locally to test if the stream is working:

```Javascript
let ws = new WebSocket('ws://transactionStreamIP:8008')
ws.addEventListener('message', message => {console.log('message', message)})
ws.addEventListener('error', message => {console.error('error', message)})
ws.addEventListener('open', message => {console.log('open', message)})
```
